#+TITLE: Styles

This repository contains a cohesive set of
styles that I use across my websites.

It may become a CSS framework in the future,
but for now it's a small set of text formatting rules.

To add this to your side, add 
``` css
 @import url("https://jakeisnt.github.io/styles/main.css");
```
to the top of your CSS file.
